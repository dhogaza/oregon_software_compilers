-- next priorities:

0. fix unique ID of varops built on regparams for proper
   clobbering INCLUDING cse tracking in proc call stuff.

   -- Easiest approach would seem to be to allocate space for
      all reg params in allocparam, then have the code generator
      save them when necessary.  We're talking a max of 64 bytes for
      allocating space for 8 general 8 byte registers, 64 bytes for
      real/double floating point registers.

   -- Need to encode the flag that forces the regparam to memory with
      regid, most likely.  For structured values passed in [a] register[s],
      those accessed by nested procedures, etc.

   -- need to do something about keytables and stack temps, rather than
      keysize track the true bottom of the stack?  Use properreg pointers
      to the allocated space with specially allocated keys based on the
      level pseudoop?

1. enter and restore loop code
2. function return values
5. instantiation of integers to include large numbers.
6. instantiation of integers as bitmasks
7. long address index values, consider alignment
8. REVERSE STACK PARAM PUSHES

-- more general

1. if current block makes no calls allocate regtemps to
   callee-saved registers.
2. look into registerfunction


Advantages of using negative sp offsets when generating code:

1. no need to adjust offsets when growing the stacks, just
   track the maximum depth of the stack.
2  can simplify by only deleting unnecessary saves to the stack
   and ignoring space reclamation (this doesn't depend on 
   stack offsets being negative).
3. parameter offsets can be kept positive.
4. at the end, adjust all negative stack offsets by the maximum
   depth.  not adjusting param positive offsets keeps them at
   the top of the stack where they need to be for function
   calls.
5. restore stackoffset at restorelabel but keep maxstackoffset
   untouched of course.
6. haven't figured out how to reclaim space and don't care much
   at the moment.

Big integer issues:

1. materializing integers will require some work though the first
   effort should just be a string of moves to build up the proper
   length number.

2. materialized integers are most likely not worth preserving as
   on high-end aarch64 cores mov/movk pairs execute in a single
   cycle.  Preserving the resulting register is a one instruction
   win in space but no gain in speed and eats a register that might
   be useful elsewhere.  Default integers are 32-bit.  64-bit integers
   take four instructions or two cycles.  Unless they can be
   generated as bitmasks.

3. big index offsets are a pain.  Most likely preserving them, once
   calculated, isn't all that worthwhile. 

4. Ignore all of the above until some stuff actually works.

Register parameters:

1. Complications include short structs that are passed in two registers.
   GCC passes the struct on the stack if there aren't two variables left.

2, Huge complication regarding records with uniform float/double fields that
   will fit in the parameter registers.

3. r8 is used to pass the pointer to large non-fp return values.

Future enhancements to improve:

1. This will require new pseudoops with some way to pass the add/sub
   operand along with the normal left/right ones, preferably without
   losing targeting.
   a) combine multiply followed by add or subtract into MADD/MSUB
   b) combine multiply followed by aindx with length of 1 (no scaling)
      into addrop+MADD/MSUB.
1. vectorization because that was something I always wanted to do ...

Peephole needs:

1. Two register loads from consecutive memory address converted to
   ldp insruction.
